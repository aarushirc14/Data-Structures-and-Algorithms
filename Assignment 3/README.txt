Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees
CPSC 319: Assignment 3- With BONUS


This program will read input from a text file and create a Binary Search Tree with the data. It will then output to 2 files. The first file will contain the data fields in chronological order(depth first). The second file will contain elements as they appear in the tree from top to bottom, left to right (breadth first).

To Compile: javac BinaryTreeTest.java AVLTreeTest.java BinaryTree.java Queue.java TreeNode.java

Please Note: 
Input files must go under the "input" folder which is included in the submission 
(avlTest.txt is an input that I made up for the bonus). 
input.txt, firstOutputFile.txt and secondOutputFile.txt should be replaced with chosen files for input and output.

To Run: java BinaryTreeTest input.txt firstOutputFile.txt secondOutputFile.txt
An example cmd for running: java BinaryTreeTest a3input1.txt depthFirst.txt breadthFirst.txt
An example cmd for running (bonus): java AVLTreeTest avlTest.txt avlDF.txt avlBF.txt

Output data files breadthFirst.txt, depthFirst.txt (from a3input1) and avlDF.txt, avlBF.txt (for the bonus) are included in the submission under the "output" folder.
